# SAF Footprint Calculator

A visual tool to understand the land use implications of transitioning the global aviation industry to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

## 🌍 The Problem

To halt climate change, we must stop extracting fossil carbon. While cars and heating can be electrified, aviation presents a unique physics problem: **Energy Density**.

*   **Jet Fuel**: ~43 MJ/kg
*   **Current Batteries**: ~0.9 MJ/kg

To fly a Boeing 747 across the Atlantic on batteries, the battery alone would weigh **40x more** than the entire plane currently does. For the 25,000+ commercial aircraft in service today, liquid hydrocarbon fuels are the only viable option for long-haul flight.

## ✈️ The Solution: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is chemically almost identical to fossil jet fuel but is made from renewable sources. However, not all SAF is created equal. This calculator helps visualize the trade-offs between different production methods:

### 1. Bio-SAF (First Generation)
Made from crops like Corn, Soy, or Palm Oil.
*   **Pros**: Mature technology, cheaper than e-fuels.
*   **Cons**: Massive land footprint. Replacing 100% of jet fuel with corn ethanol would require arable land roughly the size of India (~3.5 Million km²).

### 2. E-Fuels (Power-to-Liquid)
Synthetic kerosene made from green hydrogen and captured CO₂.
*   **Pros**: Extremely land-efficient (Solar is ~50x more efficient than photosynthesis).
*   **Cons**: High cost and energy intensity. Requires ~20-25 kWh of electricity per liter of fuel.

## 📊 Key Facts

*   **Aviation's Footprint**: Aviation accounts for **2.5%** of global CO₂ emissions. If it were a country, it would be the 6th largest emitter in the world.
*   **Land Use Context**:
    *   **Livestock Feed**: ~15 Million km² (Current global usage)
    *   **100% Bio-SAF**: ~3.5 Million km² (Projected need)
    *   **100% Solar E-Fuel**: ~0.07 Million km² (Projected need)
